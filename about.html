		After spending the entire 2015 season with Scuderia Toro Rosso, he started his 2016 campaign with the Italian team before being promoted into Red Bull Racing after 4 races as a replacement for Daniil Kvyat. He won the 2016 Spanish Grand Prix in his debut race for Red Bull Racing at the age of 18, becoming the youngest-ever winner of a Grand Prix and the first racing under the Dutch flag.
